 # Project Overview
 As an Entry Level Front End Developer, in age of Artificial Intelligence, being able to leverage with AI 
 can save you and the company time, and also money for the company. In this project I was able to do just that.

Instead of coding html, css and JavaScript, I used AI to produce the interactive script 
for the project so I can only spend time on styling the app.

The Prompt:
Build a 5 question multiple choice quiz app. validate each question when an answer is selected and submit it
before moving to the next question. style correct answer background color with green and incorrect answer
background color with red. give total score.
